# Unhandled API Response in Dart: Missing Robust Error Handling

This example showcases a common issue in Dart applications that interact with external APIs. The code fetches data, but lacks sufficient error handling for unexpected API responses. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.

**The bug:** The `fetchData` function assumes the API always returns a JSON list where each item has a `name` property. It doesn't check for potential issues like:

* The API returning a different status code (e.g., 404, 500).
* The response body not being a valid JSON list.
* The JSON objects not containing the expected 'name' property.
* Network errors during the API call.

**The solution** introduces comprehensive error handling, verifying the response status, checking data type, handling missing keys, and managing network errors gracefully.
